### **Sales System for an Auto Parts Distributor**

Hello World!
In this space I would like to showcase one of the very first projects I have ever developed through code. During my first semester of college I created a sales system for an Auto Parts Distributor using C++. This program has the following functions:
- register a sale and generate a bill
- display all the current bills
- indicate the seller with the most and least amount of sales
- exhibit the client with the most and least purchases
- present the article with the most and least sales
- display the bills organized by date.

Moreover, the process of the development of this project consisted of several phases.
1. An outline of the possible functionalities of the code was made.
2. Data regarding auto parts was collected.
3. CSV files were made with the data collected.
4. A Diagram of Unified Modeling Language (UML) was created using the classes that are neede in the code.
5. The coding process started.
