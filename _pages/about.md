Hello! My name is Silvana and I am studying a B.S. in Computer Science and Technology. I am currently working with Pyhton, C++, R, and Matlab. I am interested in learning more about bioinformatics as well as artificial intelligence and data science. I would love to learn from others and collaborate in proyects that help solve problems that people face on a daily basis. My pronouns are she/her. I speak spanish (native), english (advanced), and german (beginner). My strenghs include writing, public speaking, creatitvity, team work, responsibility, adaptabiliy, and honesty. Moreover, during my free time I like to listen to music, write, draw, pratice calligraphy, and watch k-dramas (my favorite is Crash Landing on You).
